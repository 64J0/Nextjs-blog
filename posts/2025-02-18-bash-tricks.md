Notes on bash tricks that could help you become more productive by leveraging
keyboard instead of using the mouse.

## Creating new terminal tabs

In order to create a new bash terminal tab using the keyboard one can use the
following keys:

-   *Ctrl + Shift + t*
-   *C-S-t* using Emacs terminology

## Switching between tabs

And to switch between different terminal tabs one can use:

-   *Alt + tab_number* (example: *Alt + 1*)
-   *M-{number}* using Emacs terminology

## Searching at the history

Other than this, you can search through the terminal history using *C-r* which
will use the **reverse-i-search** utility.

## Kill a tab

Finally, to kill the terminal you are currently in, the **exit** command must be
enough.
